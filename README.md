# Project Title: Smart Irrigation :seedling:

This is a project that utilizes IoT devices to create a smart irrigation system for agriculture. The system is designed to monitor soil moisture levels and automatically irrigate crops when necessary. The project includes hardware components such as Raspberry Pi and sensors, as well as software components such as Python scripts and a web-based dashboard.
## Features :rocket:

    Automated irrigation based on soil moisture levels
    Real-time monitoring of soil moisture levels
    Remote control of the irrigation system via a web-based dashboard
    Alerts for low soil moisture levels and other potential issues
    Flexible configuration options for different crop types and irrigation needs

## Setup and Installation :wrench:

    Clone the repository to your local machine
    Install the required Python packages
    Connect the hardware components (Raspberry Pi and sensors) as per the instructions
    Run the Python scripts to start the system
    Access the web-based dashboard to monitor and control the system
